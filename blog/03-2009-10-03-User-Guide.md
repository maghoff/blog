If you can get a hold of this project, this is how you use it. It is not polished in every aspect quite yet, but it is indeed usable.

------------

	sudo apt-get install mercurial python python-gdata markdown
	
	hg clone <source> blog
	ln -s `pwd`/blog/blog.py <dir-in-path>/blog


Adding a blog to a project
--------------------------

	cd <path-of-project>
	blog init


Adding a blog-post
------------------

From anywhere inside the project:

	EDITOR=<editor> blog add

Then execute

	blog publish

You will be asked for all required details, including your Google-password. The details will be remembered, except for the password. Instead, a login will be performed and the login-token will be kept.

User-specific details will be written to `~/.blog.user`, while project-specific details go to `.blog` in the project directory. You will want to add this last file to source control.
