Blogging for the rest of us
===========================

After lots of trying, I finally found a blog name on blogger that wasn't occupied. "bftrou" stands for "Blogging for the rest of us". It seems that a lot of people are perfectly satisfied with writing in a web interface, potentially losing their blog post due to a browser crash or intermittent connection failure or similar, with no revision control and just keeping the blog on that one place on the web. The rest of us are not, and this tool is for us.

Suggestions for better names that are available are accepted :)


Source
------

The source code, and therefore the entire project, is not publicly available yet, due to a rather large outage of [bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). Bitbucket places the blame with Amazon. The best source for news on this is unfortunately [twitter](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23bitbucket).


Completeness
------------

Since you can't see the project, you can't evaluate it. For now, I can at least assure you that this blog is being written in markdown and published with this tool. It works!
